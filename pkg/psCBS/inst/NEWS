Package: psCBS
==============

Version: 0.6.2 [2010-07-14]
o CLEAN UP: Added callNaiveHeterzygotes() which is a cleaned up
  version of findheterozygous().  Added an Rd example that asserts
  that the two are identical and compares the calls to those of
  aroma.light::callNaiveGenotypes().


Version: 0.6.1 [2010-07-09]
o Added low-level segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which runs paired PSCBS
  segmentation on a single sample and a single chromosome.
  It only segments; it does not call segments.  This is only
  a stub in the sense that it still does not adjust p-values etc.
o Added low-level segmentByCBS(), which runs CBS segmentation
  on a single sample and a single chromosome.
o BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Now psCNA() returns a list of length 8.
o Reverted psSegment() back to v0.5.6.


Version: 0.6.0 [2010-07-08]
o Now psSegmentPaired() returns a data frame (no longer a matrix).
o CLEANUP: Major cleanup, i.e. renaming variables, reordering etc.
o CLEANUP: Created psSegmentPaired() from psSegment().
o ROBUSTNESS: Replaced all 1:n with seq(length=n) to deal with n == 0.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all list elements are referenced by name.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all iterator variables are written as ii, jj etc.
o Using setMethodS3() of R.methodsS3 to define S3 method.
o Dropping NAMESPACE while package is finished.  This makes it
  easier to patch methods etc.


Version: 0.5.6 [2010-07-07]
o Added example(psSegment).
o BUG FIX: Previous clean up introduced bugs.
o BUG FIX: The dynamic library for hrmode() was not loaded.


Version: 0.5.5 [2010-05-05]
o CLEAN UP/ROBUSTNESS: Major code clean up.


Version: 0.5.4 [2010-04-30]
o Added internal hrmode().
o CLEAN UP: Renamed source files to match function names.
  Only only function per source file.


Version: 0.5.3 [2010-04-22]
o ABO updated the psCBS algorithm.


Version: 0.5.2 [2010-0?-??]
o ???


Version: 0.5.1 [2010-03-31]
o Now psSegment(..., matching.reference=TRUE) does TumorBoost 
  normalization on the allele B fractions before segmentation.


Version: 0.5.0 [2010-03-12]
o Added to R-forge repository.
