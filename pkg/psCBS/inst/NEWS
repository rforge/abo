Package: psCBS
==============

Version: 0.8.2 [2010-10-17]
o Added argument 'tbn' to segmentByPairedPSCBS() specifying whether
  TumorBoostNormalization should be applied or not.


Version: 0.8.1 [2010-10-10]
o The default for segmentByPairedPSCBS() is now to segment TCN on
  the original scale, not the sqrt().
o Added plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.8.0 [2010-10-06]
o CLEAN UP: Removed all old code, native code and help pages.


Version: 0.7.8 [2010-10-03]
o Added optional argument 'chromosome' to segmentByCBS().
  Note that at this point it is only used for annotating the
  results; it can not be used to segmented multiple chromosomes
  at ones.


Version: 0.7.7 [2010-09-26]
o Now subsetBySegments() and postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS 
  handles multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.7.6 [2010-09-24]
o Added support to annotating and subsetting also by chromosomes,
  as well as appending segmentation results from different chromosomes
  together.


Version: 0.7.5 [2010-09-21]
o Added postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS, which updates the 
  TCN segment start and ends, estimates and counts given the
  DH segments.


Version: 0.7.4 [2010-09-18]
o Added argument 'chromosome' to segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which, if given,
  adds a chromosome column to the data and segmentation results.
o BUG FIX: plot() for PairedPSCBS used a non-defined variable.


Version: 0.7.3 [2010-09-16]
o Added callABandHighAI() for calling paired PSCBS segmentation results.
o Added internal bootstrapping functions.


Version: 0.7.2 [2010-09-15]
o Added more methods for the PSCBS class.


Version: 0.7.1 [2010-09-08]
o Added more methods for the PSCBS class.
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() also returns the TumorBoost normalized data.


Version: 0.7.0 [2010-09-04]
o Updated segmentByPairedPSCBS() to provide two-step segmentation 
  from first segmenting the total copy numbers and then the
  decrease-of-heterozygosity signals.  Added utility functions for
  plotting the results.  The code for calling allelic imbalance
  and LOH is still to be added.


Version: 0.6.3 [2010-09-02]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now segmentByCBS() also works if there are no data points.


Version: 0.6.2 [2010-07-14]
o CLEAN UP: Added callNaiveHeterzygotes() which is a cleaned up
  version of findheterozygous().  Added an Rd example that asserts
  that the two are identical and compares the calls to those of
  aroma.light::callNaiveGenotypes().


Version: 0.6.1 [2010-07-09]
o Added low-level segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which runs paired PSCBS
  segmentation on a single sample and a single chromosome.
  It only segments; it does not call segments.  This is only
  a stub in the sense that it still does not adjust p-values etc.
o Added low-level segmentByCBS(), which runs CBS segmentation
  on a single sample and a single chromosome.
o BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Now psCNA() returns a list of length 8.
o Reverted psSegment() back to v0.5.6.


Version: 0.6.0 [2010-07-08]
o Now psSegmentPaired() returns a data frame (no longer a matrix).
o CLEANUP: Major cleanup, i.e. renaming variables, reordering etc.
o CLEANUP: Created psSegmentPaired() from psSegment().
o ROBUSTNESS: Replaced all 1:n with seq(length=n) to deal with n == 0.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all list elements are referenced by name.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all iterator variables are written as ii, jj etc.
o Using setMethodS3() of R.methodsS3 to define S3 method.
o Dropping NAMESPACE while package is finished.  This makes it
  easier to patch methods etc.


Version: 0.5.6 [2010-07-07]
o Added example(psSegment).
o BUG FIX: Previous clean up introduced bugs.
o BUG FIX: The dynamic library for hrmode() was not loaded.


Version: 0.5.5 [2010-05-05]
o CLEAN UP/ROBUSTNESS: Major code clean up.


Version: 0.5.4 [2010-04-30]
o Added internal hrmode().
o CLEAN UP: Renamed source files to match function names.
  Only only function per source file.


Version: 0.5.3 [2010-04-22]
o ABO updated the psCBS algorithm.


Version: 0.5.2 [2010-0?-??]
o ???


Version: 0.5.1 [2010-03-31]
o Now psSegment(..., matching.reference=TRUE) does TumorBoost 
  normalization on the allele B fractions before segmentation.


Version: 0.5.0 [2010-03-12]
o Added to R-forge repository.
