Package: psCBS
==============

Version: 0.9.23 [2010-11-28]
o BUG FIX: The algorithm in segmentByCBS() that infers which loci (of
  the ones share the same genomic positions) that should be exclude
  from each segment did not take missing signals into account.
o BUG FIX: Iff argument 'chromosome' to segmentByPairedPSCBS() was of
  length greater than one and specified exactly one unique chromosome,
  then exception "Number of elements in argument 'chromosome' should
  be exactly 8712 not 86209 value(s)" would be thrown.


Version: 0.9.22 [2010-11-27]
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() would incorrectly include
  non-polymorphic loci in the set of homozygous SNPs during resampling.
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() would not accept missing values in
  argument 'chromosome'.


Version: 0.9.21 [2010-11-27]
o Now arguments '...' of segmentByPairedPSCBS() are passed to
  the two segmentByCBS() calls.
o Added callSegmentationOutliers(), which can be used to identify
  single-locus outliers that have a genomic signal that is clearly
  outside the expected range.  The dropSegmentationOutliers() sets
  locus outliers detected by this method to missing values. 
  This is useful for excluding total copy-number outliers that
  otherwise can have a dramatic impact on the non-robust CBS method.


Version: 0.9.20 [2010-11-26]
o Added optional argument 'chromosomes' to plotTracks() to plot a
  subset of all chromosomes.
o Added extractByChromosomes() for PSCBS.
o Now the default confidence intervals for plotTracks() is (0.05,0.95),
  if existing.
o Now all call functions estimate symmetric bootstrap quantiles for
  convenince of plotting confidence intervals.
o BUG FIX: callABandHighAI() for PairedPSCBS used the old DH-only
  bootstrap method.
o BUG FIX: The statistical sanity checks of the bootstrap estimates
  would give an error when only single-sided bootstrap confidence
  interval was calculated.
o BUG FIX: The call functions, for instance callABandHighAI(), would throw
  'Error in quantile.default(x, probs = alpha) : missing values and NaN's
  not allowed if 'na.rm' is FALSE' unless bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() was
  run before.


Version: 0.9.19 [2010-11-23]
o ROBUSTNESS: Added more sanity checks to bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion().
o WORKAROUND: The precision of the mean levels of DNAcopy::segment()
  is not great enough to always compare it to that of R's estimates.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() would give an error if there was
  only one segment.
o BUG FIX: segmentByPairedPSCBS() and bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() 
  would not subset the correct set of DH signals if there were some
  missing values in TCN.


Version: 0.9.18 [2010-11-22]
o Added argument 'calls' to plotTracks() for highlighing called regions.
o Updated callAllelicBalanceByDH() and callExtremeAllelicImbalanceByDH()
  to utilize bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion().
o ROBUSTNESS: Now drawConfidenceBands() of PairedPSCBS silently does
  nothing if the requested bootstrap quantiles are available.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would not
  correctly detect if bootstrap results are already available.


Version: 0.9.17 [2010-11-21]
o Now plotTracks() supports tracks "tcn,c1", "tcn,c2" and "c1,c2" too.
o Added support for flavor "tcn&dh" in segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which
  contrary to "tcn,dh" enforces TCN and DH to have the same change
  points.  The default flavor is now "tcn&dh".
o Added argument 'xlim' to plotTracks() making it possible to zoom in.


Version: 0.9.16 [2010-11-21]
o Now joinSegments=TRUE is the default for segmentByCBS() and
  segmentByPairedPSCBS().
o Added argument 'quantiles' to plotTracks(), which if specified
  draws confidence bands previously estimated from bootstrapping.
o Added drawConfidenceBands() for PairedPSCBS.
o Added bootstrapTCNandDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS.
o Added standalone joinSegments() for CBS results.
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() also returns minor and major 
  copy numbers for each segment.


Version: 0.9.15 [2010-11-21]
o Adjusted postsegmentTCN() such that the updated TCN segment boundaries
  are the maximum of the DH segment and the support by the loci.  This
  means that postsegmentTCN() will work as expected both when signals
  where segmented with 'joinSegments' being TRUE or FALSE.
o Updated plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS such that the TCN segmentation
  is colored 'purple' and the DH segmentation 'orange' for TCH and DH
  only tracks.


Version: 0.9.14 [2010-11-20]
o Now it is possible to specify the boundaries of the regions to
  be segmented as known change points via argument 'knownCPs'.
o Added argument 'joinSegments' to segmentByCBS() and 
  segmentByPairedPSCBS() in order to specify if neighboring 
  segments should be joined or not.
o Now segmentByCBS() and segmentByPairedPSCBS() allow for 
  unknown genomic positions as well as missing total CN signals.


Version: 0.9.13 [2010-11-19]
o Added argument 'joinSegments' to segmentByCBS() in order to specify
  if neighboring segments should be joined or not.


Version: 0.9.12 [2010-11-19]
o Added plotTracks() and drawLevels() etc to CBS results.
o Now segmentByCBS() allows for unknown genomic positions.
o Now segmentByCBS() allows for missing signals.
o Added argument 'preserveOrder' to segmentByCBS().  If TRUE, then
  the loci in the returned 'data' object are ordered as the input
  data, otherwise it is ordered along the genome.


Version: 0.9.11 [2010-11-16]
o Now the 'data' object returned by segmentByCBS() contains field
  'index' if and only if the loci had to be reorder along the genome.
o DOCUMENTATION: Added more details, references to papers, and cross
  links to other functions to the help pages.
o BUG FIX: In the rare cases where two loci at the same positions are
  split up into two neighboring segments, then segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  would fail to infer which they were if and only if the loci were not
  ordered along the genome.  This could happen with for instance
  Affymetrix GenomeWideSNP_6 data.


Version: 0.9.10 [2010-11-09]
o Added argument 'cex=1' to plotTracks().
o BUG FIX: It was not possible to plot BAF tracks with plotTracks().


Version: 0.9.9 [2010-11-05]
o BUG FIX: segmentByCBS() tried to pass non-existing argument
  'undo.split' to DNAcopy::segment().  It should be 'undo.splits'.


Version: 0.9.8 [2010-11-04]
o BUG FIX: There was a stray/debug stop() statement left in  
  segmentByPairedPSCBS() causing an "error" in the rare case 
  when loci that have the same physical locations are split
  into two different segments.


Version: 0.9.7 [2010-11-03]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now bootstrapDHByRegion() uses resample() of R.utils.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() did not sample from the correct
  unit(s) when there was only one DH signal.


Version: 0.9.6 [2010-11-02]
o Added arguments 'undoTCN' and 'undoDH' to segmentByPairedPSCBS().
o Added argument 'undo' to segmentByCBS(), which corresponds to
  undo.splits="sdundo" and undo.SD=undo, if undo < +Inf.
o BUG FIX: Arguments 'alphaTCN' and 'alphaDH' of segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  were not used when more than one chromosome were segmented.


Version: 0.9.5 [2010-11-01]
o Added arguments 'alphaAB' and 'alphaHighAI' to callABandHighAI().
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() would give an error if only a single
  quantile was requested.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() would give "Error in if (nbrOfUnits
  > segJJ[, "dh.num.mark"]) { : missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed"
  when 'dh.num.mark' was NA.


Version: 0.9.4 [2010-10-25]
o Now the default is a 95% confidence interval for calls.
o Now segmentByCBS() also returns element 'lociNotPartOfSegment',
  if there are segments that share end points, which can happen if
  a change point is called in middle of a set of loci that have the
  same genomic positions.  In such cases, 'lociNotPartOfSegment'
  specifies which loci are *not* part of which segment.  Then by
  identifying the loci that are within a segment by their positions
  and excluding any of the above, one knows exactly which loci
  CBS included in each segment.
o BUG FIX: Now bootstrapDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS handles the
  rare case when markers with the same positions are split in 
  two different segments.
o BUG FIX: Now the correct set of loci are extracted from each TCN
  segment, in the rare case that two neighboring TCN segments have
  the same end points.


Version: 0.9.3 [2010-10-25]
o Added argument 'ciRange' to callAllelicBalance() and
  callExtremeAllelicImbalance().
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would bootstrap 
  from the incorrect set of loci when the DH region contained 
  only one locus.
o BUG FIX: bootstrapDHByRegion() for PairedPSCBS would bootstrap 
  from the incorrect set of loci if more than one chromosome 
  was available.


Version: 0.9.2 [2010-10-24]
o BUG FIX: plotTracks() would give "Error: object 'nbrOfLoci' not found'
  for whole-genome plots.


Version: 0.9.1 [2010-10-20]
o Now plotTracks() can plot whole-genome data.


Version: 0.9.0 [2010-10-18]
o Added arguments 'alphaTCN' and 'alphaDH' to segmentByPairedPSCBS()
  with defaults according to the paper.


Version: 0.8.3 [2010-10-18]
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() can segment multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.8.2 [2010-10-17]
o Added argument 'tbn' to segmentByPairedPSCBS() specifying whether
  TumorBoostNormalization should be applied or not.


Version: 0.8.1 [2010-10-10]
o The default for segmentByPairedPSCBS() is now to segment TCN on
  the original scale, not the sqrt().
o Added plotTracks() for PairedPSCBS.


Version: 0.8.0 [2010-10-06]
o CLEAN UP: Removed all old code, native code and help pages.


Version: 0.7.8 [2010-10-03]
o Added optional argument 'chromosome' to segmentByCBS().
  Note that at this point it is only used for annotating the
  results; it can not be used to segmented multiple chromosomes
  at ones.


Version: 0.7.7 [2010-09-26]
o Now subsetBySegments() and postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS 
  handles multiple chromosomes.


Version: 0.7.6 [2010-09-24]
o Added support to annotating and subsetting also by chromosomes,
  as well as appending segmentation results from different chromosomes
  together.


Version: 0.7.5 [2010-09-21]
o Added postsegmentTCN() for PairedPSCBS, which updates the 
  TCN segment start and ends, estimates and counts given the
  DH segments.


Version: 0.7.4 [2010-09-18]
o Added argument 'chromosome' to segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which, if given,
  adds a chromosome column to the data and segmentation results.
o BUG FIX: plot() for PairedPSCBS used a non-defined variable.


Version: 0.7.3 [2010-09-16]
o Added callABandHighAI() for calling paired PSCBS segmentation results.
o Added internal bootstrapping functions.


Version: 0.7.2 [2010-09-15]
o Added more methods for the PSCBS class.


Version: 0.7.1 [2010-09-08]
o Added more methods for the PSCBS class.
o Now segmentByPairedPSCBS() also returns the TumorBoost normalized data.


Version: 0.7.0 [2010-09-04]
o Updated segmentByPairedPSCBS() to provide two-step segmentation 
  from first segmenting the total copy numbers and then the
  decrease-of-heterozygosity signals.  Added utility functions for
  plotting the results.  The code for calling allelic imbalance
  and LOH is still to be added.


Version: 0.6.3 [2010-09-02]
o ROBUSTNESS: Now segmentByCBS() also works if there are no data points.


Version: 0.6.2 [2010-07-14]
o CLEAN UP: Added callNaiveHeterzygotes() which is a cleaned up
  version of findheterozygous().  Added an Rd example that asserts
  that the two are identical and compares the calls to those of
  aroma.light::callNaiveGenotypes().


Version: 0.6.1 [2010-07-09]
o Added low-level segmentByPairedPSCBS(), which runs paired PSCBS
  segmentation on a single sample and a single chromosome.
  It only segments; it does not call segments.  This is only
  a stub in the sense that it still does not adjust p-values etc.
o Added low-level segmentByCBS(), which runs CBS segmentation
  on a single sample and a single chromosome.
o BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY: Now psCNA() returns a list of length 8.
o Reverted psSegment() back to v0.5.6.


Version: 0.6.0 [2010-07-08]
o Now psSegmentPaired() returns a data frame (no longer a matrix).
o CLEANUP: Major cleanup, i.e. renaming variables, reordering etc.
o CLEANUP: Created psSegmentPaired() from psSegment().
o ROBUSTNESS: Replaced all 1:n with seq(length=n) to deal with n == 0.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all list elements are referenced by name.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all iterator variables are written as ii, jj etc.
o Using setMethodS3() of R.methodsS3 to define S3 method.
o Dropping NAMESPACE while package is finished.  This makes it
  easier to patch methods etc.


Version: 0.5.6 [2010-07-07]
o Added example(psSegment).
o BUG FIX: Previous clean up introduced bugs.
o BUG FIX: The dynamic library for hrmode() was not loaded.


Version: 0.5.5 [2010-05-05]
o CLEAN UP/ROBUSTNESS: Major code clean up.


Version: 0.5.4 [2010-04-30]
o Added internal hrmode().
o CLEAN UP: Renamed source files to match function names.
  Only only function per source file.


Version: 0.5.3 [2010-04-22]
o ABO updated the psCBS algorithm.


Version: 0.5.2 [2010-0?-??]
o ???


Version: 0.5.1 [2010-03-31]
o Now psSegment(..., matching.reference=TRUE) does TumorBoost 
  normalization on the allele B fractions before segmentation.


Version: 0.5.0 [2010-03-12]
o Added to R-forge repository.
